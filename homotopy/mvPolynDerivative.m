%  Compute the partial derivative of the multivariate polynomial p
%  with respect to the j-th variable
%
%  Syntax:   >> q = mvPolynDerivative(p,j)
%
%  Input: 
%    p -- polynomial in coefficient matrix
%    j -- index of the variable w.r.t. which the derivative is to be taken
%
%  Output:  multivariate polynomial as the partial derivative
